                  This Privacy Policy describes what MEETAAP gathers from and about you as a User of its services and
                  platforms, how MEETAAP uses it, and the controls you have over the disclosure of your information to
                  other users. As a condition of becoming a User, or using MEETAAP’s services or platforms in any way,
                  you consent to the handling practices described in this Policy and to this Policy. To a certain
                  extent, the privacy of what you provide MEETAAP may be regulated by you adjusting your profile.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  When you use MEETAAP services, platform cookies – small text files containing a string of alphanumeric
                  characters – will be transmitted to your device, either session cookies, persistent cookies, or both.
                  Flash and other browser plug-in applications may also be transmitted.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  MEETAAP collects the first and last name, Email, mobile phone number.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  MEETAAP will use what you provide and what it collects, automatically or otherwise, to operate,
                  maintain, enhance, and provide its features, services, and platforms. MEETAAP uses all or some of what
                  you provide or that MEETAAP collects to understand and analyze the usage trends and preferences of our
                  Users, to improve the way the Services work and look, and to create new features and functionality.
                  While MEETAAP is not in the business of selling the personal information you provide, the company will
                  access your personally identifiable information in connection with developing, maintaining, and
                  operating its services and platforms. However, MEETAAP will not share or sell any information that may
                  identify you personally with any third parties, and your personal information will never leave
                  MEETAAP’s platforms as a result of any action taken by MEETAAP. Besides, MEETAAP will not eavesdrop on
                  your conversations, record them, or transcribe them to text at any time.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  MEETAAP may also disclose your information if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief
                  that such action is necessary or useful to comply with applicable laws, to respond to a court order,
                  judicial or other government subpoena or warrant, or to otherwise assist or cooperate with law
                  enforcement activity or other similar activities in connection with internal or coordinated fraud
                  detection and prevention, and the protection or enforcement of third-party rights. MEETAAP will also
                  disclose what you provide it as it deems appropriate or necessary to avoid liability, to protect
                  itself or others from fraudulent, abusive, predatory, or unlawful uses or activity, to investigate and
                  defend itself against any claims or allegations; to protect the security or integrity of its services
                  or platforms, or to protect or vindicate the rights, property, or personal safety of MEETAAP, its
                  Users, or others.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  MEETAAP may retain what you submit for various purposes, including backups and archiving, prevention
                  of fraud and abuse, and analytics. MEETAAP shall not be responsible for the content, privacy, or
                  security practices and policies of third-party sites or services despite third-party links being
                  displayed in its services or platforms.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  MEETAAP does not ensure or warrant the security of anything you transmit to MEETAAP, nor does MEETAAP
                  guarantee that what you provide will not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed as a result of
                  any breach of any physical, technical, or managerial safeguards, or any absence or malfunction
                  thereof. What you transfer to MEETAAP is at your own risk. However, should MEETAAP become aware of any
                  such problem affecting or potentially affecting what you provide, MEETAAP will attempt to notify you
                  electronically so that you may take appropriate protective steps.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  The services and platforms are intended for users located across the world. Your information may be
                  stored and processed in any country in which MEETAAP or its Users maintain facilities. For purposes of
                  sharing or disclosing data under this Privacy Policy, MEETAAP may transfer, store, and process your
                  information outside of your country.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Apart from the terms of user data access and usage indicated above, MEETAAP provides you the user with
                  the ability to control access or display of your personal information. You have the choice to display
                  to other users or make private certain types of personal data listed under your account or profile.
                  MEETAAP does not have access to the controls under your account, and the display of your information
                  is solely at your discretion. MEETAAP makes no guarantee that when you display your personal
                  information, the data may be read or accessed by other users and used to their benefit.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  MEETAAP does not systemically track your location on an ongoing basis or store this information for
                  future use. However, when you use certain features of MEETAAP’s Services, certain information about
                  your precise or approximate location as determined through data such as your IP address or mobile
                  device’s GPS may be collected to offer you an improved user experience. In addition, parts of our
                  services may use maps services from 3rd parties such as Google Maps, Apple Maps, and Waze. The use of
                  each service is subject to the respective service’s terms of use (including Google Maps Additional
                  Terms of Use) and their respective privacy policies. We recommend you read the terms of the respective
                  service of use and privacy policies before using them.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  MEETAAP may make changes to this Privacy Policy at its sole discretion. Each change will become
                  effective on a going-forward basis only and as noted as a part of the change itself. You will be bound
                  by each change unless you terminate your Usership and cease using all services and platforms before
                  the change becomes effective. Your continued use after the change becomes effective constitutes your
                  consent to it.
                  <br />
                  <br />
